# 🌟 Portfolio Website

Hi, I’m Sidharth Singh — a passionate Frontend, Backend, Full-Stack, Web, and Software Developer.

I specialize in building modern, responsive, and user-friendly applications by combining creativity with robust technical expertise. From crafting engaging UI/UX designs to managing complex backend systems, I enjoy working across the entire development stack.

-- On the Frontend, I focus on React, Redux, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and Material UI to create seamless, interactive, and visually appealing experiences.
-- On the Backend, I work with Node.js, Express, and database systems to develop scalable and secure solutions.
-- As a Full-Stack Developer, I bridge the gap between client-side and server-side, ensuring smooth integrations and performance.
-- Beyond web apps, I explore software development practices, problem-solving, and innovative tools to stay ahead in the tech world.

I’m constantly learning, improving, and pushing my limits to deliver high-quality solutions. My goal is to create applications that not only work efficiently but also leave a lasting impact on users.
